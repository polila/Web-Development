*	CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.
*	CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.
*	Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
*	Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
*	IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.
*	Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.
*	Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
*	The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.
*	Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
